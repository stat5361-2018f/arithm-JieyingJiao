Floating number is represented in computer as :
$$(-1)^{x_0}(1+\sum_{i = 1}^tx_i2^{-i})2^k$$


In a 64 bits machine, $x_0$ takes 1 sign bites, significant takes 52 bits, so 
$t$ can be 52 at most. Exponent $k$ takes 11 bits, so $2^11 = 2048$ possible 
values. With shifting to negative side, k can be from -1022 to 1023, with both 
-1023 (all zeros) amd 1024 (all ones) are left for special numbers.


".Machine$double.xmax" is the largest floating number that computer can display, 
it is $(1+\sum_{i = 1}^{52}2^{-i})\times 2^{1023}$


".Machine$double.xmin" is the smallest floating numer that computer can display, 
it is $2^{-1022}$.


".Machine$double.eps" is the smallest positive floating number that the computer 
can tell the difference by adding it. It is actually the smallest significant, 
that is $2^{-52}$.


".Machine$double.neg.eps" is the smallest positive floating number that the 
computer can tell the difference by substracting it. It is $2^{-53}$.
